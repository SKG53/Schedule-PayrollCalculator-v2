# Payroll v26 — Data File Formats

Two kinds of files go into the app: a **Schedule** (the planned roster) and **Actuals** (what actually happened). Below is the exact structure each one needs. No sample files are kept in this repository (it is public and `.gitignore` excludes `*.xlsx`); build them from the layouts below.

---

## 1. Schedule file (one per entity, per week)

**Filename:** anything — the app asks which entity each upload belongs to.

**Sheet name:** `Schedule` (the first sheet is used regardless of name, but keep it simple).

**Layout:**

| Column A | Column B | Column C | Column D | Column E | Column F | Column G | Column H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | `Sunday` | `Monday` | `Tuesday` | `Wednesday` | `Thursday` | `Friday` | `Saturday` |
| (blank) | 4/12/2026 | 4/13/2026 | 4/14/2026 | 4/15/2026 | 4/16/2026 | 4/17/2026 | 4/18/2026 |
| Elbow | OFF | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | OFF |
| Marble | OFF | 7:00AM - 3:00PM | 7:00AM - 3:00PM | OFF | 7:00AM - 3:00PM | 7:00AM - 3:00PM | OFF |

### Rules

- **Row 1** — headers: `Name`, then the seven day names starting with Sunday.
- **Row 2** — the dates for that week (Sunday first). These drive which week is being processed.
- **Rows 3+** — one employee per row.
- **Shift cells** — either a time range like `6:45AM - 2:15PM` or the literal word `OFF`.
  - AM/PM is required.
  - A space-hyphen-space between start and end is the cleanest separator, but `6:45AM-2:15PM` also works.
  - **Overnight shifts** — just write them normally, e.g. `10:00PM - 6:00AM` or `11PM - 7AM`. The app knows an end earlier than the start means the shift crosses midnight.
- **Everyone on the schedule is the roster.** There is no separate employees list. If an employee isn't on the schedule that week, they won't appear in actuals.

## 2. Actuals intake file (combined-format xlsx)

The app supports two kinds of actuals input:
1. **Images** — physical timecards or EasyClocking screenshots, run through OCR inside the app.
2. **A combined xlsx** — when you already have clock data from somewhere else.

This section is for the xlsx path.

**Sheet name:** `Employee Time Clock Data` (first sheet is used).

**Columns (row 1 is the header row):**

| Col | Header | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `Entity` | `DOWNTOWN STORE` | **Must equal an entity name in the app** (case-insensitive). Rows whose entity matches no entity are skipped and listed in the import toast. |
| B | `Employee Name` | `Elbow` | Must match the scheduled name (fuzzy match tolerates minor typos). |
| C | `Date` | `4/13/2026` | Excel date. The work date is the clock-in date. |
| D | `Day of the Week` | `Monday` | Optional label, ignored by the app but useful for humans. |
| E | `Clock In 1` | `6:47 AM` | Excel time. |
| F | `Clock Out 1` | `2:16 PM` | Excel time. |
| G | `Clock In 2` | `12:30 PM` | Leave blank if no second punch. |
| H | `Clock Out 2` | `2:15 PM` | |
| I | `Clock In 3` | (blank) | For employees with three punch pairs. |
| J | `Clock Out 3` | (blank) | |

### Rules

- **One row per employee per workday**, even if there are multiple punch pairs. Use columns E–J to express the pairs, not multiple rows.
- **Overnight shifts** — put the clock-in date as the date. For example, a shift that starts `10:00 PM` on 4/14 and ends `6:01 AM` on 4/15 goes on the **4/14** row with `Clock In 1 = 22:00` and `Clock Out 1 = 06:01`.
- **Missing punches** — leave cells blank. The app flags them in the review step.
- **Wage** is NOT in this file — it's set per employee inside the app.

## 3. Optional: image intake instead of xlsx

If you don't have a combined xlsx, you can upload:

- **Physical timecard photos** (TOPS 1256 or similar) — handwriting-friendly model (Gemini Pro) reads each stamp row.
- **EasyClocking screenshots** — screenshot-friendly model (Gemini Flash) reads the table rows.

No naming convention required — the app asks which entity each image belongs to, and you review every extracted punch before it hits the payroll sheet.

## Quick checklist before uploading

- [ ] Schedule file has Sunday in column B and dates in row 2.
- [ ] Shift cells either say `OFF` or `H:MMAM - H:MMPM`.
- [ ] Actuals xlsx has all 10 headers in row 1 in the exact order above.
- [ ] Overnight shift actuals are dated by clock-in date, not clock-out date.
- [ ] Break minutes required are set per entity (default 0) before you export.

## 4. Files the app writes and re-imports

| File | Schema tag | Re-import |
|---|---|---|
| Actuals Intake (`Actuals_Intake_<date>.xlsx`) | `SPCalcActualsIntakeV1` | Yes — first 10 columns are the combined layout above, then Approved, Source, Image, Confidence, Flags, Suggested Name, Row ID. `Source = MN` marks a manual or reviewer-edited row (FC-00029). Matches by entity name. |
| Payroll Settings (`Payroll_Settings_<date>.xlsx`) | `SPCalcPayrollSettingsV3` (+ `V2` when breaks are included) | Yes — Entity, Employee, Wage/hour, Type, Flat Amount, Pay Method, Deposit Amount, Deposit Typed As, Employee ID, Aliases (JSON array), Active, Final Pass Method, Notes, Palette, then optional break columns. Matched by column name, so older files still load. |
| Payroll reports (Cash-Only, Deposit-Only, Combined, Time Card Data, Payroll Calculation, Full; Excel + PDF) | — | No (output only). |
