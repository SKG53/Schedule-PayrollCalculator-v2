# Schedule & Payroll Calculator

A lightweight, single-file payroll app that turns weekly schedules and clock-in/out images into a clean payroll report. Runs entirely in your browser — no backend, no database, no vendor lock-in. Multi-entity by design.

## Live app

https://skg53.github.io/Schedule-PayrollCalculator/

Every push to `main` redeploys it (see *Deployment* below).

## What it does

- **Schedules tab** — upload or build a weekly schedule per entity. Roster for the week comes from this schedule.
- **Actuals Intake tab** — drop photos of physical timecards and/or EasyClocking screenshots. Gemini OCR extracts every punch pair. You review each row before it hits payroll.
- **Payroll tab** — set wages per employee (hourly or flat), set mandatory break minutes per entity, export a payroll report. Employees with no wage are left blank rather than guessed.

No data is saved on any server, and **no payroll data is stored in your browser**.
Schedules, punches, hours, wages and reports live in memory only and are gone the
moment you refresh or close the tab. That is deliberate.

The only things kept in `localStorage` are your Gemini API key and your model
preferences. That means:
- You can close the tab and come back, and your API key is still there.
- Everything else starts empty every time. Export before you leave.
- Anything that needs to survive between weeks — roster, wages, pay methods, break
  settings — goes in the **settings file**, which you export and re-import.
- Clearing your browser data wipes only the API key and model choices.
- Nothing about your employees or hours ever leaves your machine except the images
  and schedule context sent to Google Gemini for OCR.

There is no login and no password. The app is public framework that holds no data,
so there is nothing to gate.

## Getting started

1. **Get a Gemini API key.** Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), create a key. Recommended: set a $5-10/month budget cap at [console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
2. **Paste it into the app.** Click the Settings button, paste the key, click Save. The badge turns green (`Saved · AIza…xxxx`) when it sticks.
3. **Upload a schedule.** Schedules tab → pick an entity → drop the week's `.xlsx` (format below). The roster is whatever's on the schedule.
4. **Upload your punch data.** Actuals Intake tab → drop images for that entity → click Run OCR. Each image shows queued → running → done/err.
5. **Review.** Each extracted row shows any flags (missing punches, names not on the schedule, etc.). Approve rows manually.
6. **Set wages + break minutes.** Payroll tab. Wages can be hourly or flat per employee.
7. **Export** the payroll report as an `.xlsx`.

## Schedule file format

Sheet 1. Columns A–H:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | `Sunday` | `Monday` | `Tuesday` | `Wednesday` | `Thursday` | `Friday` | `Saturday` |
| (blank) | 4/12/2026 | 4/13/2026 | 4/14/2026 | 4/15/2026 | 4/16/2026 | 4/17/2026 | 4/18/2026 |
| Elbow | OFF | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | 6:45AM - 2:15PM | OFF |

Shift cells are either `H:MMAM - H:MMPM` or the literal word `OFF`. Overnight shifts like `10:00PM - 6:00AM` work — the app knows an earlier end means it crosses midnight.

## Punch image formats

- **Physical timecards** — TOPS 1256 or similar. The app reads the green machine-stamped punches in the REGULAR TIME column. Attributes each shift to the clock-in date.
- **EasyClocking screenshots** — clean table rows. Each row = one punch pair.

Drop them into the Timecard or EasyClocking drop zone. The app routes each to the right Gemini model (Pro for handwriting, Flash for screenshots).

## Gemini cost

Typical weekly batch costs cents, not dollars. Flash ≈ $0.15 input / $0.60 output per 1M tokens. Pro ≈ $1.25 / $10 per 1M. Images are small. A full week of 10-employee timecards runs well under a penny per week.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/pages-preview.yml` runs on every push to `main`: it copies `index.html`
into a fresh `gh-pages` branch (force-pushed, one commit) and GitHub Pages serves that.

Pages setting: Repo → **Settings** → **Pages** → **Source** = "Deploy from a branch",
**Branch** = `gh-pages`, **Folder** = `/ (root)`.

## Tests

```
npm test            # same as: node --test "tests/*.test.js"   (Node 21+)
```
