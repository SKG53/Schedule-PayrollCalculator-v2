## What
The Combined PDF's entity subtotal and grand-total rows carry the same values, in the same columns, as the Combined Excel and the preview.

## Why
The PDF summed each entity's Rounded Final and wrote it into the Diff column, so its totals disagreed with the Excel and the preview.

## Fix
Sum `actualFinal` into Actual Total, add Deposit and Cash subtotals, leave Rounded Final and Diff blank — identical to `_exportExcel` combined mode.

## Where in UI
Payroll tab → Combined Report → PDF.

## Touches
exports

## Risk
Low — PDF totals rows only.

## Reversibility
Fully reversible via one revert commit.

## Definition of Done
1. PDF total rows equal Excel total rows and preview total rows to the penny.
2. Actual Total carries the amount; Rounded Final and Diff blank.

## Out of scope
Other PDF kinds.

## Assumptions
None.

## Open questions
None.
